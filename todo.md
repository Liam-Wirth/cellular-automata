# General:
1. [ ] Fix Drag navigation in UI
2. [ ] Toroidal Viewport
    -  [ ] When the user drags the viewport, the cells should wrap around
3. [ ] Fix the grid, it looks wrong
3. [ ] Functionality to click on a square when simulation is paused to create a new cell/remove a cell (toggle cell)
4. [ ] Clear board button
5. [ ] "Stamps" of common patterns (Glider, etc)
6. [ ] Statistics panel
7. [ ] Add other simulations (brians brain, etc)
8. [ ] Get Export + Import Pattern working
8. [ ] Tab for the elementary celular automata
    a. [ ] In this tab, I want the user to choose a number for a rule, but also be able to define a rule by just clicking on some boxes
    b. say like this:
    1. 000 -> 0
    2. 001 -> 1 
    3. 010 -> 1
    4. 011 -> 1
    5. 100 -> 0
    6. 101 -> 1
    7. 110 -> 1
    8. 111 -> 0
    (and then when the user defines that rule, let it show the number of the rule in the UI)
