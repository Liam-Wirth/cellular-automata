# For conways:
* "Infinite/ Wallpaper" Mode, basically, if population gets less than some amount, spawn in a couple more randomly, just to keep things constantly moving
* Toggle for tiling walls (basically overlapping as if the walls aren't there), and "hard" walls
* Toggle to infinitely draw the map to fill the viewscreen and give the impression that the simulation is infinite
